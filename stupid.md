"The sun sure is bright today, could use some clouds"
"I saw a dragon once... Just kidding. Or am I?"
"If only those adventurers would stop breaking things."
"Have you heard the new bard's melodies? It's all anyone can talk about now."
"I once adventured with a hero who slayed ten dragons in one day! But I forgot their name..."
"You look tired, adventurer. Maybe try a nap in the inn?"
"I can tell you where to find a good meal. The tavern over by the docks is my favorite!"
"I was going to be an adventurer once, but then I took an arrow to the knee."
"You should be careful walking around here at night, there are monsters around."
"What do people usually do for fun when they're not adventuring?"
"Have you ever tried singing while walking? It makes things go faster, trust me."
"I heard that bandits have been spotted near the border. Be careful if you're headed that way."
"I know this area like the back of my hand, so if you need directions just ask."
"Remember to stock up on supplies before heading out for a long journey!"
"Treat yo' self to some new gear, adventurer."
"Conquering dungeons really builds up your glutes."
"I'm doing this for the free ale, to be honest."
"You gotta get your cardio in somehow, why not fighting monsters?"
"Don't be a Jerry, come prepared for battle."
"This is my side gig when I'm not selling artisanal wares."
"Live every day like it's Ragnorok."
"The most important weapon is confidence, trust me."
"I've been behind that desk too long, time to see the world starting with this dungeon."
"Camping under the stars with a pack of goblins just isn't the same as glamping with friends."
"I've got new spells and I'm not afraid to use them!"
"Why fight alone when you can have a squad, protecting your six and cheering you on."
"We're fighting Titans, don't give up or you won't survive."
"Humanity may be outnumbered, but we won't be defeated."
"Keep moving forward, take them down one Titan at a time."
"Our weapons may be sharp, but it's our determination that wins the battles."
"They may be big, but we're quicker and smarter."
"This mission is everything, we can't let anything stand in our way."
"We'll make history by defeating these Titans and protecting our people."
"Fighting Titans is dangerous work, but what else would we be doing? Sitting at home?"
"I never thought I'd be fighting Giants like this, but I'm ready for the challenge!"
"As long as there are Titans, we will fight back with courage and strength."
"I joined the Corps to protect my family against Titans, nothing can stop us!"
"This was a triumph. I'm making a note here: HUGE SUCCESS."
"Just stop it already and give up. You don't have to go through this."
"I don't hate you."
"The birth parents you are trying to reach do not love you, please hang up."
"Remember when the platform was sliding into the fire pit? And I said 'Goodbye' and you were like 'no way'? And then I was all, 'We pretended we were going to murder you.' That was great."
And here are some GLaDOS quotes from Portal 2:

"Welcome back. Testing is available."
"There was even going to be a party for you... a big party that all your friends were invited to. I invited your best friend the companion cube. Of course, he couldn’t come because you murdered him. All your other friends couldn’t come either, because you don’t have any other friends. Because of how unlikable you are. It says so here in your personnel file: Unlikable. Liked by no one. A bitter unlikable loner whose passing shall not be mourned. Shall NOT be mourned... that’s exactly what it says. Very formal. Very official. It also says you were adopted...so that’s funny too."
"Oh. Did I accidentally fizzle that before you could complete the test? I’m sorry. Go ahead and grab another one. Oh. No. I fizzled that one too."
"You euthanized your faithful Companion Cube more quickly than any test subject on record. Congratulations."
"Oh good! My slow clap processor made it into this thing. So we have that."
